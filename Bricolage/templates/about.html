    The <span class='bold-4'>Bricolage Co-op</span> is an autonomous student run space meant to foster creativity, direct involvement, and a <span class='bold-1'>do-it-ourselves</span> spirit. It aims to help Haverford students, faculty and staff to sell and/or <span class='bold-2'>trade</span> their own <span class='bold-4'>art</span>, clothes, furniture, knick knacks, and other skills, enacting values often left ideological or abstract and in the classroom. By focusing on offering avenues for fruitful <span class='bold-3'>production</span> and <span class='bold-1'>skill-sharing</span> as well as non-conventional forms of exchange and payment, this cooperative hopes to model the potential for <span class='bold-2'>alternative economies</span>. Through this process, the cooperative hopes to foster an alternative community within Haverford, <span class='bold-4'>connected</span> by relationships both social, moral, and economic, and in line with principles the college already upholds, such as mutual accountability and an honor system. Furthermore, the cooperativeâ€™s <span class='bold-3'>community</span> driven operation/organization/function allows it to serve as a model for a political process currently lacking on campus offering the possibility for <span class='bold-1'>direct engagement/involvement</span> in democratic elections. Though the individuals and context may change, and the space and programs are subject to constant alterations and development, the mission remains the same: to fill an ethical and social need for autonomy, exploration, and <span class='bold-2'>empowerment</span>.
